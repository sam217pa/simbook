# Coalescent simulation using msprime {#usingmsprime}

Kelleher *et al.* [-@Kelleher2016-cb] described a new approach to simulating the coalescent with recombination taking advantage of tree sequence data structures (Chapter \@ref(treeseqs)).  They describe an open-source software package called `msprime`, which is an evolution of `ms` [@Hudson2002-oo], which is (or, was) the "industry standard" software for coalescent simulation for the better part of two decades.  Many authors (too many to cite here) have modified `ms` in various ways.  Doing so was often difficult for various reasons, but it was how a large number of researchers cut their teeth on learning how to implement coalescent models.  I think it is safe to say that those days are almost over--the performance improvements of `msprime` over `ms` means that the community is better off investing on code bases using tree sequences.  Further, Kelleher *et al.* [-@Kelleher2016-cb] cleverly decided to provide a command line interface to `msprime` that behaves exactly as `ms` does, meaning that a simple alias in a user's environment can update existing work flows.

Performance aside, the major benefit of `msprime` is that it is implemented as a Python library rather than as a command-line package. (The `mspms` program mentioned above is installed with `msprime` to provide a command-line interface to a subset of the package's functionality).  Abstracting out the operations into a set of library functions and objects has many advantages.  First, the interface is greatly simplified, especially for complex demographic models, which may now be built up in "chunks" of Python logic (and comments, too!).  Second, much of the analysis of the simulation can be done in-memory, completely avoiding the need to write output to files.  

This chapter is a short tour of `msprime`'s key features. I strongly encourage you to read the [manual](http://msprime.readthedocs.io), as well as a tutorial by Jerome Kelleher (CITATION when it comes out).

## Obtaining msprime

* [Source code](http://github.com/tskit-dev/msprime) is on github.
* The [manual](http://msprime.readthedocs.io) is auto-generated on Read The Docs.
* Binary builds for Linux and OS X are available from [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/msprime).
* You may also install via `pip3`.

There are Docker images in the works for `msprime`, but I recommend `conda` for most users, as you have access to "everything" that way.

*Note*: `msprime` is a `python3` package.

## Running a simple simulation

```{python}
import msprime

# Simulate n=10 genomes
ts = msprime.simulate(10, mutation_rate=10.,
                      recombination_rate=10.)
```

The data type is a tree sequence:

```{python}
type(ts)
```

## Parameter scaling

By default, `msprime` using a scaling of `N` generations in the Python package.  Parameters like the mutation and recombination rates are in these units.
Thus, the default "scaled mutation rate" is $N\mu$, where $\mu$ is the neutral mutation rate (per haploid genome, per generation), and the following two command lines would give results that are identical in distribution:

```{python}
import msprime

ts = msprime.simulate(10, mutation_rate=25.0)
tw2 = msprime.simulate(10, mutation_rate=0.25, Ne=100)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:msprimeScaling) shows the ECDF of the number of mutation from $10^4$ replicates of each command line, and you can see that they are right on top of one another.  The figure for the code is in \@ref(msprimescalingcode).

```{r, msprimeScaling, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Parameter scaling in msprime"}
knitr::include_graphics("msprime_scaling.png")
```

For the examples shown above, `mutation_rate=25.0` implies $N\mu = 0.25$, and `mutation_rate=0.25` implies $0.01N\mu = 0.25$ as we are measuring time in units of $100N$ generations.  Many theory papers present results in units of $2N$ generations and `ms` scales time in units of `4N` generation.  You may set $Ne = 0.5$ or $0.25$, respectively, to obtain those scalings.

For example, if we want to model $\theta = 4N\mu = 100$ and $\rho = 4Nr = 100$, then the following are all equivalent:

```{python, eval=F}
theta, rho = 100.0, 100.0
ts = msprime.simulate(10,
                      mutation_rate=theta/4.,
                      recombination_rate=theta/4.)
ts = msprime.simulate(10,
                      mutation_rate=theta/2.,
                      recombination_rate=theta/2., Ne=0.5)
ts = msprime.simulate(10,
                      mutation_rate=theta,
                      recombination_rate=theta, Ne=0.25)
```

Let's take a look at the scaling at work.  We will also see how to run many simulation replicates sequentially, and see one scheme for reproducible seeding:

```{python, code=readLines("chapters/msprime/listings/scaling.py")}
```

In general, one of the biggest challenges that people have in applying simulations is in dealing with scaling differences between different simulation programs.  I almost always need to resort to pictures on a whiteboard to get the conversions right, especially between different programs.
