# Coalescent simulation using msprime

## Parameter scaling

By default, `msprime` using a scaling of `N` generations in the Python package.  Parameters like the mutation and recombination rates are in these units.
Thus, the default "scaled mutation rate" is $N\mu$, where $\mu$ is the neutral mutation rate (per haploid genome, per generation), and the following two command lines would give results that are identical in distribution:

```{python}
import msprime

ts = msprime.simulate(10, mutation_rate=25.0)
tw2 = msprime.simulate(10, mutation_rate=0.25, Ne=100)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:msprimeScaling) shows the ECDF of the number of mutation from $10^4$ replicates of each command line, and you can see that they are right on top of one another.

```{r, msprimeScaling, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Parameter scaling in msprime"}
knitr::include_graphics("msprime_scaling.png")
```

In general, one of the biggest challenges that people have in applying simulations is in dealing with scaling differences between different simulation programs.
