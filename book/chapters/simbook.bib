              programs that support a wide range of features, such as arbitrary
              demographic models, migration, and sub structure. Defining the
              model is done typically with either text files or command line
              switches. Although this has proven to be a powerful method of
              defining models of high complexity, it is often error prone and
              difficult to read without familiarity both with command lines and
              the program in question. A intuitive GUI based population
              structure program that can both read and write applicable command
              lines would dramatically simplify the construction, modification,
              and error checking of such models by a wider user base. RESULTS:
              PopPlanner is a tool to both construct and inspect complicated
              demographic models visually with a GUI where the user's primary
              interaction is through mouse gestures. Because of their
              popularity, we focus on ms and by extension msms, command line
              coalescent simulation programs. Our program can be used to find
              errors with existing command lines, or to build original command
              lines. Furthermore, the graphical output supports a number of

              formal tests for whether mixture occurred and make it possible to
              infer proportions and dates of mixture. We also describe the
              development of a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array
              consisting of 629,433 sites with clearly documented ascertainment

               genetic history of a population in forwards-time,
               individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary
               breeding models, population structure and demography. This
               approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of
               tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only
               those loci that may affect reproduction (those having
               non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is
               recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the
               software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be
               quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each
               breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time,
               but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We
               solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly
               'simplify' a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history
               for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the
               history with respect to the extant population, we show that the
               total storage space required is modest and overall large
               efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time
               simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for
               recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used
               to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We
               modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use
               this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large,
               whole-genome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In
               addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has
               several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the
               simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes.
               (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can
               be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a
               simulation's entire final generation as well as its history. (3)
               A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient
               coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for

  author    = "Haller, Benjamin C and Galloway, Jared and Kelleher, Jerome and

  abstract  = "There is an increasing demand for evolutionary models to
               incorporate relatively realistic dynamics, ranging from
               selection at many genomic sites to complex demography,
               population structure, and ecological interactions. Such models
               can generally be implemented as individual-based forward
               simulations, but the large computational overhead of these
               models often makes simulation of whole chromosome sequences in
               large populations infeasible. This situation presents an
               important obstacle to the field that requires conceptual
               advances to overcome. The recently developed tree-sequence
               recording method (Kelleher et al., 2018), which stores the
               genealogical history of all genomes in the simulated population,
               could provide such an advance. This method has several benefits:
               (1) it allows neutral mutations to be omitted entirely from
               forward-time simulations and added later, thereby dramatically
               improving computational efficiency; (2) it allows neutral
               burn-in to be constructed extremely efficiently after the fact,
               using ``recapitation''; (3) it allows direct examination and
               analysis of the genealogical trees along the genome; and (4) it
               provides a compact representation of a population9s genealogy
               that can be analyzed in Python using the msprime package. We
               have implemented the tree-sequence recording method in SLiM 3 (a
               free, open-source evolutionary simulation software package) and
               extended it to allow the recording of non-neutral mutations,
               greatly broadening the utility of this method. To demonstrate
               the versatility and performance of this approach, we showcase
               several practical applications that would have been beyond the
               reach of previously existing methods, opening up new horizons
               for the modeling and exploration of evolutionary processes.",

              mating subpopulations. Yet, the standard approach to modelling
              these populations is to impose an arbitrary grid of demes,
              adjusting deme sizes and migration rates in an attempt to capture
              the important features of the population. Such indirect methods
              are required because of the failure of the classical models of
              isolation by distance, which have been shown to have major
              technical flaws. A recently introduced model of extinction and
              recolonisation in two dimensions solves these technical problems,
              and provides a rigorous technical foundation for the study of
              populations evolving in a spatial continuum. The coalescent
              process for this model is simply stated, but direct simulation is
              very inefficient for large neighbourhood sizes. We present
              efficient and exact algorithms to simulate this coalescent

              depends on when in the history of the sample the selected
              substitutions happen, the strength of selection and the amount of
              crossing over between the sampled locus and the loci at which the
              selected substitutions occur. This phenomenon is commonly called
              hitchhiking. Using the coalescent process for a random sample of
              genes from a selectively neutral locus that is linked to a locus
              at which selection is taking place, a stochastic, finite
              population model is developed that describes the steady state
              effect of hitchhiking on the distribution of the number of
              selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample. A
              prediction of the model is that, in regions of low crossing over,
              strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can
              substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random
              sample of genes from that expected under a neutral model.",

  abstract = "The level of DNA sequence variation is reduced in regions of the
              Drosophila melanogaster genome where the rate of crossing over
              per physical distance is also reduced. This observation has been
              interpreted as support for the simple model of genetic
              hitchhiking, in which directional selection on rare variants,
              e.g., newly arising advantageous mutants, sweeps linked neutral
              alleles to fixation, thus eliminating polymorphisms near the
              selected site. However, the frequency spectra of segregating
              sites of several loci from some populations exhibiting reduced
              levels of nucleotide diversity and reduced numbers of segregating
              sites did not appear different from what would be expected under
              a neutral equilibrium model. Specifically, a skew toward an
              excess of rare sites was not observed in these samples, as
              measured by Tajima's D. Because this skew was predicted by a
              simple hitchhiking model, yet it had never been expressed
              quantitatively and compared directly to DNA polymorphism data,
              this paper investigates the hitchhiking effect on the site
              frequency spectrum, as measured by Tajima's D and several other
              statistics, using a computer simulation model based on the
              coalescent process and recurrent hitchhiking events. The results
              presented here demonstrate that under the simple hitchhiking
              model (1) the expected value of Tajima's D is large and negative
              (indicating a skew toward rare variants), (2) that Tajima's test
              has reasonable power to detect a skew in the frequency spectrum
              for parameters comparable to those from actual data sets, and (3)
              that the Tajima's Ds observed in several data sets are very
              unlikely to have been the result of simple hitchhiking.
              Consequently, the simple hitchhiking model is not a sufficient
              explanation for the DNA polymorphism at those loci exhibiting a
              decreased number of segregating sites yet not exhibiting a skew
              in the frequency spectrum.",

              revealing the evolutionary processes operating in natural

              ability to model realistic evolutionary scenarios and predict
              their expected patterns in genomic data. To that end, we present
              SLiM 2: an evolutionary simulation framework that combines a
              powerful, fast engine for forward population genetic simulations
              with the capability of modeling a wide variety of complex
              evolutionary scenarios. SLiM achieves this flexibility through
              scriptability, which provides control over most aspects of the
              simulated evolutionary scenarios with a simple R-like scripting
              language called Eidos. An example SLiM simulation is presented to
              illustrate the power of this approach. SLiM 2 also includes a
              graphical user interface for simulation construction, interactive

              facilitating easy and fast model development with quick
