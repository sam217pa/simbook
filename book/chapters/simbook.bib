  abstract = "Population mixture is an important process in biology. We present
              a suite of methods for learning about population mixtures,
              implemented in a software package called ADMIXTOOLS, that support
              formal tests for whether mixture occurred and make it possible to
              infer proportions and dates of mixture. We also describe the
              development of a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array
              consisting of 629,433 sites with clearly documented ascertainment
              that was specifically designed for population genetic analyses
              and that we genotyped in 934 individuals from 53 diverse
              populations. To illustrate the methods, we give a number of
              examples that provide new insights about the history of human
              admixture. The most striking finding is a clear signal of
              admixture into northern Europe, with one ancestral population
              related to present-day Basques and Sardinians and the other
              related to present-day populations of northeast Asia and the
              Americas. This likely reflects a history of admixture between
              Neolithic migrants and the indigenous Mesolithic population of
              Europe, consistent with recent analyses of ancient bones from
              Sweden and the sequencing of the genome of the Tyrolean
              ``Iceman.''",

               genetic history of a population in forwards-time,
               individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary
               breeding models, population structure and demography. This
               approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of
               tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only
               those loci that may affect reproduction (those having
               non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is
               recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the
               software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be
               quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each
               breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time,
               but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We
               solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly
               'simplify' a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history
               for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the
               history with respect to the extant population, we show that the
               total storage space required is modest and overall large
               efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time
               simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for
               recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used
               to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We
               modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use
               this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large,
               whole-genome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In
               addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has
               several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the
               simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes.
               (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can
               be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a
               simulation's entire final generation as well as its history. (3)
               A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient
               coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for
               recording and processing tree sequences is named tskit.",

  abstract = "Many species have an essentially continuous distribution in
              space, in which there are no natural divisions between randomly
              mating subpopulations. Yet, the standard approach to modelling
              these populations is to impose an arbitrary grid of demes,
              adjusting deme sizes and migration rates in an attempt to capture
              the important features of the population. Such indirect methods
              are required because of the failure of the classical models of
              isolation by distance, which have been shown to have major
              technical flaws. A recently introduced model of extinction and
              recolonisation in two dimensions solves these technical problems,
              and provides a rigorous technical foundation for the study of
              populations evolving in a spatial continuum. The coalescent
              process for this model is simply stated, but direct simulation is
              very inefficient for large neighbourhood sizes. We present
              efficient and exact algorithms to simulate this coalescent
              process for arbitrary sample sizes and numbers of loci, and
              analyse these algorithms in detail.",

              for many years. Despite this interest, almost nothing is known

              ancestors. Using both spatially continuous and stepping-stone
              models, we show that the distribution of pedigree ancestors
              approaches a travelling wave, for which we develop two
              alternative approximations. The speed and width of the wave are
              sensitive to the local details of the model. After a short time,
              genetic ancestors spread far more slowly than pedigree ancestors,
              ultimately diffusing out with radius ∼t rather than spreading at
              constant speed. In contrast to the wave of pedigree ancestors,

              provide realistic genome simulation across millions of samples.
              Present day coalescent simulations do not scale well, or use
              approximations that fail to capture important long-range linkage
              properties. Analysing the results of simulations also presents a
              substantial challenge, as current methods to store genealogies

  abstract = "The level of DNA sequence variation is reduced in regions of the
              Drosophila melanogaster genome where the rate of crossing over
              per physical distance is also reduced. This observation has been
              interpreted as support for the simple model of genetic
              hitchhiking, in which directional selection on rare variants,
              e.g., newly arising advantageous mutants, sweeps linked neutral
              alleles to fixation, thus eliminating polymorphisms near the
              selected site. However, the frequency spectra of segregating
              sites of several loci from some populations exhibiting reduced
              levels of nucleotide diversity and reduced numbers of segregating
              sites did not appear different from what would be expected under
              a neutral equilibrium model. Specifically, a skew toward an
              excess of rare sites was not observed in these samples, as
              measured by Tajima's D. Because this skew was predicted by a
              simple hitchhiking model, yet it had never been expressed
              quantitatively and compared directly to DNA polymorphism data,
              this paper investigates the hitchhiking effect on the site
              frequency spectrum, as measured by Tajima's D and several other
              statistics, using a computer simulation model based on the
              coalescent process and recurrent hitchhiking events. The results
              presented here demonstrate that under the simple hitchhiking
              model (1) the expected value of Tajima's D is large and negative
              (indicating a skew toward rare variants), (2) that Tajima's test
              has reasonable power to detect a skew in the frequency spectrum
              for parameters comparable to those from actual data sets, and (3)
              that the Tajima's Ds observed in several data sets are very
              unlikely to have been the result of simple hitchhiking.
              Consequently, the simple hitchhiking model is not a sufficient
              explanation for the DNA polymorphism at those loci exhibiting a
              decreased number of segregating sites yet not exhibiting a skew
              in the frequency spectrum.",
