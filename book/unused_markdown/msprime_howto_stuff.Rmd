## Demographic events

### Exponential growth

```{python}
config = [msprime.PopulationConfiguration(sample_size=10,
                                          initial_size=1,
                                          growth_rate=1e-4)]
ts = msprime.simulate(population_configurations=config,
                      random_seed=42)
```

### Discrete population size changes

```{python}
size_changes = [msprime.PopulationParametersChange(time=0.01,
                                                   initial_size=0.1,
                                                   population_id=0),
                msprime.PopulationParametersChange(time=0.025,
                                                   initial_size=1.0,
                                                   population_id=0)]
ts = msprime.simulate(10, random_seed=42,
                      demographic_events=size_changes)
```

### Multiple populations

Simulations with multiple demes require some forethought.  If we simply set a `config` variable listing sample sizes of different populations over time, we get an invalid model.  By default, there is no migration amongst the subpopulations, meaning an infinite time to the final coalescent event.

In the following block, `config` sets up two populations of 5 genomes each.  That is all--no migration, and the two populations never come into contact.  If we attempt to simulate with this model, `msprime` will raise an exception.  Fortunately, `msprime` contains a handy tool, `DemographyDebugger`, which prints out the model in rather plain terms.

```{python}
config = [msprime.PopulationConfiguration(sample_size=5),
          msprime.PopulationConfiguration(sample_size=5)]
dd = msprime.DemographyDebugger(population_configurations=config)
# In a regular Python session, dd.print_history()
# will write to the screen.  Here, however,
# I need to write to a file in order to
# get something that I may display in 
# this format:
with open('history.txt', 'w') as f:
    dd.print_history(f)
```

Taking a look at our history, we see two populations with no migration.  We cannot run this model:

```{r, code=readLines('history.txt'), eval=F}
```

The following adds in a "mass migration" event moving all of population one into population zero at three time units in the past:

```{python}
# Note: proportion = 1.0 is the default
demographic_events = [msprime.MassMigration(time=3.0,
                                            source=1,
                                            destination=0,
                                            proportion=1.0)]
dd = msprime.DemographyDebugger(population_configurations=config,
                                demographic_events=demographic_events)
with open('history.txt', 'w') as f:
    dd.print_history(f)
```

Our history log now shows the merge event, which gives us a valid model:

```{r, code=readLines('history.txt'), eval=F}
```

Now we have a valid model, which we can run to generate Figure \@ref(fig:multipops).  The code generating that figure is shown below,
where we also see some of `tskit`'s features for drawing trees.  (The SVG files are not easily incorporated into pdf or html output, so
we use the `convert` utility from [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) to convert them to png.  This method is used for all of the trees
shown in this book.)

```{python, code=readLines("chapters/msprime/figures/multipops.py"), eval=F}
```

```{r multipops, echo=F, fig.cap="Genealogy of two demes without migration, with the populations merging $3N$ generations ago.  Node times are labelled.  A node colored black is found in population 0, and red refers to population 1."}
knitr::include_graphics("multipops.png")
```

#### Migration

We can easily set up migration matrices using `numpy`.  The diagonal elements must all be zero, and the off-diagonal values are the migration rates between subpopulations:

```{python}
m = np.zeros(4).reshape(2,2)
# This use of np.eye is a bit tricky,
# and worth working out what it is doing:
m[~np.eye(m.shape[0], dtype=bool)] = 1e-3

dd = msprime.DemographyDebugger(population_configurations=config,
                                migration_matrix=m)
with open('history.txt', 'w') as f:
    dd.print_history(f)
```

```{r, code=readLines('history.txt'), eval=F}
```

We may add in changes to the migration matrix:

```{python}
migchanges = [msprime.MigrationRateChange(time=0.5, rate=1e-6,
                                          matrix_index=(0,1))]
dd = msprime.DemographyDebugger(population_configurations=config,
                                migration_matrix=m,
                                demographic_events=migchanges)
with open('history.txt', 'w') as f:
    dd.print_history(f)
```

```{r, code=readLines('history.txt'), eval=F}
```

### Population splits and merges

This is a population split, thinking *forwards* in time:

```{python}
c = [msprime.PopulationConfiguration(5),
     msprime.PopulationConfiguration(5)]
d = [msprime.MassMigration(time=0.1,
                           source=1,
                           destination=0,
                           proportion=1.0)]
```

The next example is a population merge, where the ancestry of population 0 is 50% from population one, and
all of the final samples are from population zero. Note that we need some process, either continuous migration or an ancient 
"mass migration" event, in order to guarantee coalescence:

```{python}
c = [msprime.PopulationConfiguration(10),
     msprime.PopulationConfiguration(0)]
d = [msprime.MassMigration(time=0.1,
                           source=0,
                           destination=1,
                           proportion=0.5),
     msprime.MigrationRateChange(time=0.1, rate=1e-2)]
dd = msprime.DemographyDebugger(population_configurations=c,
                                demographic_events=d)
with open('history.txt', 'w') as f:
    dd.print_history(f)
```

```{r, code=readLines('history.txt'), eval=F}
```

A tree from this model is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:popsplit).

**TODO:** need to show diagrams of the model, and also discuss that business that we see in the debugger, which is that pop sizes are not affected by rates splits and merges, and what affect that may have.

```{r, popsplit, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Genealogy of a population split model"}
